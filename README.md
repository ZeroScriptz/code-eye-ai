# CodeEYE [Ai]
As a seasoned software developer with a passion for creating user-friendly and efficient applications, I am proud to share my recent project where I leveraged the OpenAI API to develop a minimal ChatGPT application.

I was able to seamlessly integrate the OpenAI API into my project and utilize the provided keys to construct a robust backend. This involved implementing a streamlined process for sending and receiving data, ensuring fast and reliable performance.

On the front-end, I developed a user-friendly interface that mimics the functionality of ChatGPT, including the ability to display text with a loading sequence and retrieve responses from the AI in real-time.

Leveraging the free plans offered by Render and Vite, I was able to create a fully-functional ChatGPT application that operates like a web application, providing a seamless and efficient user experience while avoiding wait times and downtime.
